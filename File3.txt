Git is fast. With Git, nearly all operations are performed locally, giving
it a huge speed advantage on centralized systems that constantly have to
communicate with a server somewhere.

Git was built to work on the Linux kernel, meaning that it has had to 
effectively handle large repositories from day one. Git is written in C, 
reducing the overhead of runtimes associated with higher-level languages. 
Speed and performance has been a primary design goal of the Git from 
the start.
